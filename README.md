# A Management Dashboard is a web application that enables individuals to handle and analyze many elements of their organization. It is developed with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, the three essential internet technology. The dashboard is dynamic, which means it can adjust to multiple screen sizes and devices. It features a number of real-time data-display charts, graphs, and tables. Users may customize the dashboard by selecting which metrics to track and how they want them displayed.

It is critical to define clear roles and duties for each team member when creating a Management Dashboard with 5 or more team members. This ensures that everyone understands their roles and can collaborate effectively. To keep the task on track, the team will need to work more closely together on the design and development of the dashboard, utilizing agile approaches.
